# savvy-spending-planner

Create a budgeting app that supports *ALL* the following user stories:

- I want to add a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category (dropdown with e.g groceries, bills, salary), so that I can keep track of my financial activities.
- I want to view a list of my transactions, showing details like date, amount, type, and category, so that I can quickly review my financial activities.
- I want to edit an existing transaction's details in case I made an error or an update is needed, so that my transaction records are accurate.
- I want to delete a transaction if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant, so that my financial records are up to date.
- I want to filter transactions based on type (income/expense), category, or date range, so that I can find specific transactions or analyze my finances over a certain period.
- I want to see my total balance, calculated as the sum of all income minus the sum of all expenses, so that I can have a quick overview of my financial health.
- I want to export my transactions to a file (e.g, JSON) that I can save to my device, so that I can keep a backup or use the data in other applications.

***Important***
We will validate the prototype by running through all the user stories so make sure you implement **EVERY SINGLE** user story or bad things will happen. Please mock and/or use dummy data if necessary.
